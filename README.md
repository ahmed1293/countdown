## Intro

I used to watch a lot of "8 out of 10 Cats does Countdown", and I generally sucked on both rounds. So, I decided to cheat and automate them! I'm yet to make a start on the numbers.

### Letters

Given some random letters, try to generate the longest word possible.

#### Usage
`python LettersToWords.py`, then follow instructions. Note that the Unix "words" file, found in `/usr/share/dict/words` is used as a dictionary, so this script probably wont work on Windows.

### Numbers

Given six numbers and one target number, try to generate the target by using standard operations (+, -, *, /) on the six numbers. No number can be used more than once.

#### Implementation

Will write up soon...

#### Usage 

`python Numbers.py`, then follow instructions.
